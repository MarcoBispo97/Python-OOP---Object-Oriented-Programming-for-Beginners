        "\n",
        "2. **Functional 🔄**  \n",
        "   - Emphasizes functions, immutability, and avoiding side effects.  \n",
        "   - **Key Concepts:** First-class functions, higher-order functions, recursion.  \n",
        "   - **Examples:** Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Python (with functional libraries).  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Declarative 📜**  \n",
        "   - Focuses on *what* to achieve rather than *how* to do it.  \n",
        "   - **Examples:** SQL, HTML, React (in JSX).  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Logic 🧩**  \n",
        "   - Based on formal logic and rules.  \n",
        "   - Uses facts and rules to infer new information.  \n",
        "   - **Examples:** Prolog, Datalog.  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):  \n",
        "- 🛠️ A popular paradigm focusing on objects and classes to organize code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 🌟 Key Concepts of OOP:  \n",
        "1. 📢 **Message Passing:**  \n",
        "   - OOP is based on messages sent to objects, prompting them to perform actions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. 🗂️ **Objects:**  \n",
        "   - Have their own state (*attributes*) and behavior (*methods*).  \n",
        "   - **Example:** A `Car` object with attributes like `color` and `speed`, and methods like `accelerate()`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. 🏗️ **Class:**  \n",
        "   - Acts as a blueprint for creating objects; reusable as many times as needed.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** `class Car` defines the blueprint for creating car objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. 🛠️ **State & Behavior:**  \n",
        "   - **State:** Defined by attributes (variables).  \n",
        "   - **Behavior:** Defined by methods (functions).  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. 🔄 **Encapsulation:**  \n",
        "   - Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).  \n",
        "   - Access is restricted using access modifiers (public, private, protected).  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. 🧬 **Inheritance:**  \n",
        "   - Mechanism to create new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** `class ElectricCar(Car)` inherits attributes and methods from `Car`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. ⚖️ **Polymorphism:**  \n",
        "   - Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** A function that takes a `Vehicle` parameter can accept both `Car` and `Bike` objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. 🧩 **Abstraction:**  \n",
        "   - Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** A `Car` object exposes methods like `drive()` without showing internal workings.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Multi-Paradigm Approach:  \n",
        "- A single program can incorporate multiple paradigms for greater flexibility and efficiency.  \n",
        "- **Examples:**  \n",
        "   - **Python:** Supports object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural paradigms.  \n",
        "   - **JavaScript:** Supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven paradigms.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🏆 Advantages of OOP:  \n",
        "1. 🔄 **Reusability:**  \n",
        "   - Objects can be reused across programs, speeding up development and reducing costs.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** A `User` class in one project can be reused in another.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. 🛠️ **Extensibility:**  \n",
        "   - Objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors without modifying existing code.  \n",
        "   - **Example:** Adding a `brake()` method to a `Car` class without changing other methods.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. 🧩 **Modularity:**  \n",
        "   - Code is organized into separate classes/modules, making it easier to maintain and update.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. 🛠️ **Maintainability:**  \n",
        "   - Changes in one part of the program have minimal impact on others.  \n",
        "   - Easier to find and fix bugs due to the modular structure.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. 🚀 **Efficient Testing:**  \n",
        "   - More time and resources can be used to test individual modules (classes) thoroughly.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. ⚖️ **Separation of Duties:**  \n",
        "   - Clear distinction between different parts of a program, enhancing code readability and collaboration.  \n",

        "Let's explore some of their use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "◼️ Defining Constants\n",
        "A common use case is storing constants that are very closely related to the class.\n",
        "\n",

You may choose to follow this naming convention (or not) based on your personal preferences and the standards followed by your team.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "◼️ Setting Default Values\n",
        "You can also use class attribute if you need to set a default value for all the instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, this IceCream class has a discount class attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "The value of discount will be 15 by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if a custom value is passed for the discount when the instance is created, the custom value is assigned instead.\n",

        "            self.discount = discount\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "◼️ Counting Instances\n",
        "Also, if you need to know how many instances of a class have been created, you can use a class attribute to keep track of the counter.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "When a new instance is created and initialized, the current value of customer_id is assigned to the id of the instance and then it's incremented by 1, so the next instance will have the updated id.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    customer_id = 0\n",
