    "🌳 Inheritance: Building on What Exists\n",
    "Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 💻. It allows a new class (child/subclass) to take on the properties and methods of an existing class (parent/superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "A GoldenRetriever 🐕 is a Dog 🐶.\n",
    "A Dog 🐶 is an Animal 🐾.\n",
    "The GoldenRetriever inherits traits from Dog (like barking), and Dog inherits traits from Animal (like having a name or eating).\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ Key Benefits:\n",
    "♻️ Code Reusability: Write common code once in the parent class and reuse it in many child classes. No more copy-pasting!\n",
    "🧩 Extensibility: Easily add new, specific features to child classes without changing the parent class.\n",
    "🤝 \"Is-A\" Relationship: Clearly models real-world \"is-a\" relationships, making code more intuitive.\n",
    "🛠️ Polymorphism (often used with inheritance): Allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way. (e.g., dog.speak() vs cat.speak())\n",
    "🐍 Python Example:\n",
    "Let's see it in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "# Parent class (Superclass)\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # All animals have a name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is eating. 🍖\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        # This is a general speak, child classes can make it specific\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclass must implement this abstract method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child class (Subclass)\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # 🐶 Dog inherits from Animal\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the Animal's __init__ to set the name\n",
    "        self.breed = breed      # Dogs also have a breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Override the speak method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof! 🐕\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fetch(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is fetching the ball! 🎾\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another Child class\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):  # 🐱 Cat inherits from Animal\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Override the speak method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Meow! 🐈\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def purr(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is purring... rrrrr\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's create some instances!\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "my_cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dog.name)        # Output: Buddy (Inherited from Animal)\n",
    "print(my_dog.breed)       # Output: Golden Retriever (Specific to Dog)\n",
    "print(my_dog.eat())       # Output: Buddy is eating. 🍖 (Inherited from Animal)\n",
    "print(my_dog.speak())     # Output: Buddy says Woof! 🐕 (Overridden in Dog)\n",
    "print(my_dog.fetch())     # Output: Buddy is fetching the ball! 🎾 (Specific to Dog)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\n--- Now for the cat ---\")\n",
    "print(my_cat.name)        # Output: Whiskers\n",
    "print(my_cat.eat())       # Output: Whiskers is eating. 🍖\n",
    "print(my_cat.speak())     # Output: Whiskers says Meow! 🐈\n",
    "print(my_cat.purr())      # Output: Whiskers is purring... rrrrr\n",
    "🔍 Explanation of the Example:\n",
    "Animal Class (Parent 👑):\n",
    "\n",
    "Has an __init__ method to set a name.\n",
    "Has an eat method that all animals can do.\n",
    "Has a speak method, but it's marked with NotImplementedError. This means any child class should provide its own way to speak.\n",
    "Dog Class (Child 🐶):\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal): means Dog inherits from Animal.\n",
    "Its __init__ uses super().__init__(name) to call the Animal's __init__ method. This is important for initializing the inherited parts (like name).\n",
    "It adds a new attribute breed.\n",
    "It overrides the speak method to make a \"Woof!\" sound.\n",
    "It adds a new method fetch, specific to dogs.\n",
    "Cat Class (Child 🐱):\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal): means Cat also inherits from Animal.\n",
    "It overrides the speak method to make a \"Meow!\" sound.\n",
    "It adds a new method purr, specific to cats.\n",
    "When we create my_dog, it gets the name and eat functionality from Animal, but its speak is the dog-specific version. It also has its own breed attribute and fetch method. The same logic applies to my_cat!\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance helps organize code logically and efficiently, especially as programs grow larger and more complex. 🚀\n"
